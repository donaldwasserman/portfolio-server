Almost all the PR people I know are WordPress aficionados. At a recent CMPRSA Lunch and Learn, a speaker asked “Who uses WordPress” and almost everyone raised their hands.

For the past year, I’ve been moving more projects over to Drupal (although, not this sites…oops).

Why is that?

Drupal should be the preferred CMS platform of choice for public relations people and professional communicators.

WordPress is easy to use, is widely supported, has great features, and is much lighter weight than Drupal. Why should you ditch it?

One reason: we need more than just text for effective communication.

Jeff Eaton’s recent A List Apart article about the “Battle for the Body Field” highlights the problem: plugging a bunch of different types of content, including photos, videos, and/ or dynamic charts into the blank body blob invites disaster.

When are those invitations to disaster sent? All the time. during a minor redesign, or if you want repurpose content across sections of your site.

Mixing content with presentation and design elements hamstrings your efforts as you reuse content elsewhere (I've learnt my lesson about three times.)

Today, one-off communication deliverables are no longer enough. Highly structured reusable content is essential to communicate useful and engaging information.

A press release is much better when connected dynamically to image gallery. A blog post is better when connected to a product review. A product display is much better when connected to a press release and social reviews.

Drupal requires fielding all types of discrete contents and it’s views and contextual filter features (in the views module) powers dynamic content displays.

Drupal’s field framework forces communicators to use a COPE (create once, publish everywhere) framework.

This means rather than adding all the information into the body blob in WordPress, communicators can dynamically republish content in the best context for the key audiences.

*Hey, I know that WordPress has custom fields and all of that business. But this is a little trash talk.
